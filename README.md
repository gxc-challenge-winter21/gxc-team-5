Welcome to the repository of the International Avengers!
We founded our Start-Up after participating in the [GXC International Virtual Innovation Challenge 2021](https://www.hm.edu/en/international/projects_1/gxc/gxc_virtual_innovation_challenge.en.html) which is an opportunity for public governmental and non-governmental organizations to propose innovation challenges that can be solved through digital technologies by the participating students.


Together with [Deutsche Bahn Connect](https://www.deutschebahnconnect.com/de) we are developing an app to integrate [Brompton's](https://www.brompton.com/) folding bikes in german trains and train stations.


## The Challenge
The goal of the challenge was to effectively integrate folding-bikes-systems and rail usage in urban and rural areas.


## Storyboard
In our [storyboard](https://github.com/gxc-challenge-winter21/gxc-team-5/wiki/Storyboard) we explained the idea of our app and how it can help a commuter to get to work even though an unexpected event occured. This is just one of many potential use cases for our technology.

## Our App

The handling of [our app](https://github.com/gxc-challenge-winter21/gxc-team-5/wiki/Prototype-Sprint-2) is very intuitive since it's designed the same way that is the DB Navigator App which is already well known. Users can log in using their DB account or register to create a new one. 
The App then displays a map with all near bike docks and shows whether they contain available bikes or not. If all bikes are booked already the user can't adress the dock as destination. 
Within the app there is also the DB navigation integrated which allows the user to search for the best route including the folding bike system. Furthermore there is a mile system integrated so the users of folding bikes can collect points to get vouchers for selected stores or brands.

By taking a look at our [Screenshots](https://github.com/gxc-challenge-winter21/gxc-team-5/tree/main/Screenshots) you can get a first impression of the app and its main features.
